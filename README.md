# READ ME

For those who don't know, the classic 'Lorem ipsum' phrase used in graphic/web design comes from an incredibly profound work by the philosopher, Cicero. You can find it online in English with a quick Google search. I pulled this specific text from [this site](https://www.lipsum.com/)

# INSTALLATION

You should install this into your components directory within /src.  
So it should essentially look like this:

```
cd components
git clone <https://github.com/actuallyitsnathaniel/React-LoremIpsum.git>
```

Super simple, if you've used git before.  
</br>
</br>

# USAGE

Simply import the function like so in your React index.js, or wherever you want it:

```JavaScript
import {LoremIpsum} from './components/React-LoremIpsum'
```

Then call it as just a closing tag like so:

```html
<LoremIpsum />
```

It can be placed just about anywhere, it's a `<div>` split into two `<p>`'s.

## Why?

I read Cicero's "On Obligations" in college, but wasn't significantly impacted by it until recently-which is when I connected the dots that HE was "the Lorem Ipsum guy." You could imagine how invested I was in the course back then. I was too preoccupied with C.S. Lewis and other lofty writings to really care, but I sincerely wish I did.

Anyways, I created this component for React because I just wanted to make a component. It's my first component, and the simplest component to ever exist, literally just a div. And I wanted to share this thought with anyone who comes across it. I've added a personal commonplace book here, in case you're interested in some quotes I loved from "On Obligations."

## Commonplace Book

<pre>Cicero. <i>On Obligations</i>. Translated with an introduction and notes by P. G. Walsh.
    Oxford World Classics. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2000 (reissued 2008).

"The philosopher who claims that the highest good has no connection with virtue, and measures it by 
his own interests rather than by what is honorable, cannot cultivate friendship, justice, or generosity 
so long as he remains consistent in his views and is not prevailed upon by his own nature." (p. 4)

“We usually ask ourselves not only whether some action is honorable or base, but also, when there are 
two honorable courses of action, which is the more honorable; and again, if two useful courses lie open 
to us, which is the more useful.” (p. 6)

“In Plato’s words, ‘If wisdom could be seen with the eyes, it would arouse astonishing feelings of love for it.’” (p. 7)

“The more clearly a person sees the essential truth of a situation, and the keener and swifter is 
his ability to grasp and explain its logic, the more prudent and wise he is commonly and justifiably regarded.” (p. 8)

“The foundation of justice is good faith, in other words truthfully abiding by our words and agreements.” (p. 10)

“Certain obligations must be met even when they are owed to persons who have wronged us, for 
revenge and punishments have their due limits.” (p. 13)
